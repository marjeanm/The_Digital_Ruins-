For example, users can access an application like Salesforce without needing to install it directly on their local computers. Instead, the application is hosted in the cloud, allowing users to visualize data reports and perform tasks from any location while keeping HR and personal systems as secure as possible within a data center environment.</p> <p>In February 2020, a major cloud provider experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that reached a peak volume of 2.3 Tbps (terabits per second). This measure refers to the amount of data transmitted every second, typically used to determine bandwidth or internet speed. You can read more about this concept here: What is Bandwidth and How Does it Correlate to Data Rate and Data Throughput.</p> <p>This DDoS attack is considered one of the largest in history. However, limited details have been released about the incident\u2014no information regarding the target, the origin of the attack, or specific insights into the involvement of \"bad bots\" and application vulnerabilities.</p> <p>A major cloud provider offers services ranging from Development as a Service (DaaS) to storage solutions and a vast marketplace that handles sensitive customer transactions. Despite its scale, several questions remain unanswered about the incident:</p> <ul> <li> <p>2.3 Tbps peak attack volume: Does this mean the attackers managed to overwhelm the servers with such high bandwidth? If so, how were they able to generate such an enormous amount of bandwidth?</p> </li> <li> <p>Bad bots: Were these bots operational and left unpatched, or were they not effectively blocked from the network?</p> </li> <li> <p>Application vulnerabilities: Were these issues related to in-house applications or third-party connectors? Which applications were vulnerable, and why?</p> </li> <li> <p>Timeline: The only detail provided is February 2020. Was this the start of the DDoS attack, or was it when the issue was resolved?</p> </li> <li> <p>No attackers identified: No mention of perpetrators or legal actions, leaving a gap in accountability.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Understanding these specifics would help cybersecurity professionals analyze what went wrong, document the findings, strengthen playbooks, and proactively monitor for warning signs in similar situations. The lack of transparency suggests the cloud provider may have resolved the issue, but without sharing lessons learned or corrective actions, it erodes consumer trust. As a cybersecurity professional and a concerned customer, I find it troubling that such a significant event has not been properly addressed or explained.</p>"},{"location":"Blog/Social_Engineering/","title":"Social Engineering: Understanding the Tactic and Its Threats","text":"<p>Social engineering is a tactic used by malicious actors to deceive individuals into granting access or resources within an IT infrastructure. This form of attack targets the weakest point of entry in cybersecurity\u2014the human element. For example, an unauthorized user might communicate with an authorized user and manipulate them into providing access to the organization\u2019s network.</p> <p>Understanding and identifying social engineering methods is crucial because these attacks leverage various methodologies to exploit human vulnerabilities. According to Lockheed Martin\u2019s Cyber Kill Chain (Lockheed Martin, 2024), social engineering typically falls under the reconnaissance phase, during which attackers gather information such as email addresses and organizational details to plan their attack.</p>"},{"location":"Blog/Social_Engineering/#information-security-governances-role-in-protecting-against-social-engineering","title":"Information Security Governance's Role in Protecting Against Social Engineering","text":"<p>Educating all employees on cybersecurity is not merely recommended\u2014it is essential. Regular testing and re-training are necessary to ensure employees remain vigilant and prepared to address evolving threats. The responsibility for these initiatives lies with the Information Security Governance (ISG) team and executive management. These teams are tasked with protecting the organization by developing strategies, establishing policies, and providing clear authority and oversight for cybersecurity training and compliance. Strong governance ensures that employees are equipped to recognize and respond to threats, that security policies align with current cybersecurity trends, and that any weaknesses in oversight or training are identified and strengthened (Grama, 20222).</p>"},{"location":"Blog/Social_Engineering/#the-significance-of-social-engineering","title":"The Significance of Social Engineering","text":"<p>There are three main categories of social engineering: physical, psychological, and technological. Each requires focused strategies to mitigate threats and prevent exploitation. Education is critical in addressing the human element, as humans\u2014unlike computers\u2014can be swayed by emotions, overlook critical warning signs, and make errors in judgment. Training employees to recognize and respond to these tactics is essential to safeguarding an organization from social engineering attacks.</p>"},{"location":"Blog/Social_Engineering/#physical-attacks-baiting","title":"Physical Attacks: Baiting","text":"<p>Baiting is a physical form of social engineering where an attacker strategically leaves physical media, such as USB drives or CDs, to lure victims into using them on their computers. Once the media is inserted and executed, it deploys malicious code that can lock down the computer, infiltrate the file system, and exfiltrate sensitive data (Social Engineering Incidents and Preventions, 2023).</p> <p>A historical example of this concept can be loosely connected to the popularity of programs like LimeWire in the early 2000s. LimeWire was a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing system that allowed users to share and download files directly from one another without relying on a central server. While primarily used for sharing music and other media, the decentralized nature of P2P networks posed significant risks. Files shared on these platforms could be embedded with malicious code, which spread rapidly and uncontrollably between users. This highlights how social engineering tactics, even in a digital space, can exploit human curiosity and trust to deliver harmful payloads.</p>"},{"location":"Blog/Social_Engineering/#psychological-attacks-impersonation","title":"Psychological Attacks: Impersonation","text":"<p>Impersonation is a psychological attack where an attacker pretends to be someone else, often by phone or email, to gather information they would not otherwise have access to. This technique has rapidly evolved with advancements in technology, such as the use of deepfake technology and AI to mimic voices, making impersonation attacks more convincing and difficult to detect. These attacks often involve identity theft and are highly illegal, highlighting the critical need for robust security measures like multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p> <p>MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring multiple forms of verification, such as sending a token to a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) device or generating a random code for authorization. For example, instead of relying on easily guessed or manipulated security questions for a password reset on a root account, MFA could include a text message and a time-sensitive code. This approach ensures that only the authorized individual can complete the authentication process.</p> <p>Psychological attacks like impersonation are difficult to gauge, making it essential for organizations to train employees to verify identities carefully and ask appropriate, specific questions to confirm legitimacy. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the risk posed by these sophisticated attacks (\u201cHow Cyber Criminal Use Social Engineering to Target Organizations,\u201d 2022).</p>"},{"location":"Blog/Social_Engineering/#technological-attacks-spit","title":"Technological Attacks: SPIT","text":"<p>A SPIT attack, or Spam over Internet Telephony, exploits Voice over IP (VoIP) systems, which make it easier for attackers to spoof phone numbers and remain untraceable. In these attacks, malicious actors leave automated messages or directly communicate with victims, often impersonating trusted entities like banks or government agencies, to solicit money or sensitive personal information.</p> <p>Unlike traditional spam calls, SPIT attacks are sent in bulk and often use Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems to interact with targets. For example, an attacker might obtain a distribution list of phone numbers and use an automated system to call each number, leaving a callback number. The callback connects to a fake source set up to collect the requested information, such as account details or credentials.</p> <p>To mitigate the risks of SPIT attacks, employees should practice call verification, avoid calling back suspicious numbers directly, and report these incidents to the security operations team for further investigation and validation. Proper training and vigilance are essential to reduce the success rate of these increasingly common social engineering attacks.</p>"},{"location":"Blog/Social_Engineering/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>It is vital to be educated and recognize the warning signs of a social engineering attack, as these examples merely scratch the surface of the ever-evolving techniques used by malicious actors. Staying informed about emerging trends and conducting regular training or drills\u2014at least every four months\u2014are essential to maintaining awareness and preparedness.</p> <p>While the example of baiting provided may be dated, the risks posed by modern peer-to-peer (P2P) networks remain relevant. Platforms for file sharing, cryptocurrencies, and certain Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can be exploited to distribute malicious files, posing significant threats to enterprise networks. Organizations must take proactive measures, such as blocking unauthorized P2P usage and implementing layered security controls, to safeguard their systems.</p> <p>Ultimately, fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness is crucial. Empowering employees with the knowledge and tools to identify and respond to threats not only mitigates risks but also strengthens the organization\u2019s overall security posture against the persistent dangers of social engineering.</p>"},{"location":"Blog/Social_Engineering/#bibliography","title":"Bibliography","text":"<ul> <li>Grama, J.
