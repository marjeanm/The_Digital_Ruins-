# Multi-Factor Authentication

Ever heard of Two-Factor Authentication, or MFA? It’s an extra layer of security for your accounts. Here’s how it works: after you enter your password, you'll get a code sent to your phone or email to verify it’s really you. Even if someone has your password, they won’t get in without that second code. So, always enable MFA for your accounts. It's like having a second lock on your door!

Here are some examples

- Google Authenticator: Simple and widely supported app for generating time-based one-time passwords (TOTP). Easy to set up and use.

- Microsoft Authenticator: Works seamlessly with Microsoft accounts and supports TOTP for other platforms. Includes push notifications for easier logins.

- Authy: Multi-device support and cloud backups for recovery if you lose your phone. Ideal for managing multiple accounts.

- Duo Mobile: Focused on business users but also great for personal use. Offers TOTP and push notifications.

- 1Password/LastPass: Password managers with built-in TOTP generation for added convenience and security.
