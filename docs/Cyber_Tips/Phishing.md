## How to spot phishing

Phishing attacks are fake emails or messages designed to trick you into sharing personal information. They might say things like 'Your account is locked!' or 'You've won a prize!' Don’t take the bait! Always double-check the sender’s email address, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and if you're unsure, go directly to the official site. Stay smart, stay safe.
