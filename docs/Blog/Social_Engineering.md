# Social Engineering: Understanding the Tactic and Its Threats

Social engineering is a tactic used by malicious actors to deceive individuals into granting access or resources within an IT infrastructure. This form of attack targets the weakest point of entry in cybersecurity—the human element. For example, an unauthorized user might communicate with an authorized user and manipulate them into providing access to the organization’s network.

Understanding and identifying social engineering methods is crucial because these attacks leverage various methodologies to exploit human vulnerabilities. According to Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain (Lockheed Martin, 2024), social engineering typically falls under the reconnaissance phase, during which attackers gather information such as email addresses and organizational details to plan their attack.

## Information Security Governance's Role in Protecting Against Social Engineering

Educating all employees on cybersecurity is not merely recommended—it is essential. Regular testing and re-training are necessary to ensure employees remain vigilant and prepared to address evolving threats. The responsibility for these initiatives lies with the Information Security Governance (ISG) team and executive management. These teams are tasked with protecting the organization by developing strategies, establishing policies, and providing clear authority and oversight for cybersecurity training and compliance. Strong governance ensures that employees are equipped to recognize and respond to threats, that security policies align with current cybersecurity trends, and that any weaknesses in oversight or training are identified and strengthened (Grama, 20222).

## The Significance of Social Engineering

There are three main categories of social engineering: physical, psychological, and technological. Each requires focused strategies to mitigate threats and prevent exploitation. Education is critical in addressing the human element, as humans—unlike computers—can be swayed by emotions, overlook critical warning signs, and make errors in judgment. Training employees to recognize and respond to these tactics is essential to safeguarding an organization from social engineering attacks.

### Physical Attacks: Baiting

Baiting is a physical form of social engineering where an attacker strategically leaves physical media, such as USB drives or CDs, to lure victims into using them on their computers. Once the media is inserted and executed, it deploys malicious code that can lock down the computer, infiltrate the file system, and exfiltrate sensitive data (Social Engineering Incidents and Preventions, 2023).

A historical example of this concept can be loosely connected to the popularity of programs like LimeWire in the early 2000s. LimeWire was a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing system that allowed users to share and download files directly from one another without relying on a central server. While primarily used for sharing music and other media, the decentralized nature of P2P networks posed significant risks. Files shared on these platforms could be embedded with malicious code, which spread rapidly and uncontrollably between users. This highlights how social engineering tactics, even in a digital space, can exploit human curiosity and trust to deliver harmful payloads.

### Psychological Attacks: Impersonation

Impersonation is a psychological attack where an attacker pretends to be someone else, often by phone or email, to gather information they would not otherwise have access to. This technique has rapidly evolved with advancements in technology, such as the use of deepfake technology and AI to mimic voices, making impersonation attacks more convincing and difficult to detect. These attacks often involve identity theft and are highly illegal, highlighting the critical need for robust security measures like multi-factor authentication (MFA).

MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring multiple forms of verification, such as sending a token to a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) device or generating a random code for authorization. For example, instead of relying on easily guessed or manipulated security questions for a password reset on a root account, MFA could include a text message and a time-sensitive code. This approach ensures that only the authorized individual can complete the authentication process.

Psychological attacks like impersonation are difficult to gauge, making it essential for organizations to train employees to verify identities carefully and ask appropriate, specific questions to confirm legitimacy. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the risk posed by these sophisticated attacks (“How Cyber Criminal Use Social Engineering to Target Organizations,” 2022).

### Technological Attacks: SPIT

A SPIT attack, or Spam over Internet Telephony, exploits Voice over IP (VoIP) systems, which make it easier for attackers to spoof phone numbers and remain untraceable. In these attacks, malicious actors leave automated messages or directly communicate with victims, often impersonating trusted entities like banks or government agencies, to solicit money or sensitive personal information.

Unlike traditional spam calls, SPIT attacks are sent in bulk and often use Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems to interact with targets. For example, an attacker might obtain a distribution list of phone numbers and use an automated system to call each number, leaving a callback number. The callback connects to a fake source set up to collect the requested information, such as account details or credentials.

To mitigate the risks of SPIT attacks, employees should practice call verification, avoid calling back suspicious numbers directly, and report these incidents to the security operations team for further investigation and validation. Proper training and vigilance are essential to reduce the success rate of these increasingly common social engineering attacks.

## Conclusion

It is vital to be educated and recognize the warning signs of a social engineering attack, as these examples merely scratch the surface of the ever-evolving techniques used by malicious actors. Staying informed about emerging trends and conducting regular training or drills—at least every four months—are essential to maintaining awareness and preparedness.

While the example of baiting provided may be dated, the risks posed by modern peer-to-peer (P2P) networks remain relevant. Platforms for file sharing, cryptocurrencies, and certain Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can be exploited to distribute malicious files, posing significant threats to enterprise networks. Organizations must take proactive measures, such as blocking unauthorized P2P usage and implementing layered security controls, to safeguard their systems.

Ultimately, fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness is crucial. Empowering employees with the knowledge and tools to identify and respond to threats not only mitigates risks but also strengthens the organization’s overall security posture against the persistent dangers of social engineering.
