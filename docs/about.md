# About

Hi there! I am a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a passion for problem-solving, continuous learning, and contributing to a safer digital world. With over four years of experience in technology analysis and help desk support, I thrive on tackling challenges and delivering impactful solutions in fast-paced environments.

Currently, I serve as a Technology Center Analyst Lead at PNC, where I provide critical support and resolve issues related to technology products and applications. My role encompasses remote and onsite technical support, business process analysis, and incident resolution—all aimed at ensuring operational efficiency and effectiveness.

Past Experience Before stepping into my current role, I excelled as an Incident Manager, where I sharpened my skills in managing high-pressure incidents, issue escalation, and troubleshooting complex technical problems. My proactive communication and collaborative mindset ensured swift resolutions, minimizing customer impact while meeting tight deadlines.

Academic and Competitive Pursuits I'm deeply committed to continuous learning, as demonstrated by my participation in prestigious cybersecurity competitions like the National Cyber League (NCL) and NCAE CyberGames. These experiences have enhanced my skills in areas like password hashing and cryptography, adding valuable depth to my cybersecurity expertise. I'm also proud to be a member of the National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS), Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS), and ISACA, all of which inspire me to grow professionally and give back to the cybersecurity community.

Hobbies and Passions Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the world of automation and testing, using tools and platforms like IFTTT, Power Automate, Python, Selenium, and Java to streamline processes and solve challenges. This passion allows me to combine creativity and technical skills to simplify workflows and improve efficiencies.

When I’m not diving into technology, you’ll find me enjoying PC gaming, crocheting clothes, traveling, or delving into the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity and program development.
